Musiquence Eye-Gaze + VR:

At this internship I developed a project that allows to use virtual reality glasses with Eye Tracking (HTC Vive Pro Eye) to interact with

• Make Eye Tracking be implemented in projects developed in
Unity3D, making it interact with the look.

• Implement the system on the platform Musiquence (L. D.
